# My Website

Most personal websites aren't actually personal, or are made from generic templates that don't feel interesting to explore.

I challenged myself to make my website actually interesting and original, which led to a lot of fun self imposed requirements:
 - Visual design: my website should be uniquely designed and themed, with art made by me
 - Limited dependency on DOM: I wanted to push myself, and make a large chunk of the website render as a canvas
 - Mobile support: Most people are probably using a phone to browse. I'm using a phone to type this right now.

I ended up getting quite passionate about perfecting details and polishing the website, as well as changing a lot of common UI concepts with more fun ones.
 - Eg: The 'projects' tab doesn't have a list, it has a homemade physics engine simulating balls which you have to double click to view more information. (You can also fling them around if you want)
